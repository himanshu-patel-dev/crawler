```python
from crawler.models import URLRecord

URLRecord.objects.create(url="http://www.amazon.com/Cuisinart-CPT-122-Compact-2-Slice-Toaster/dp/B009GQ034C/")
URLRecord.objects.create(url="http://blog.rei.com/camp/how-to-introduce-your-indoorsy-friend-to-the-outdoors/")
URLRecord.objects.create(url="http://www.cnn.com/2013/06/10/politics/edward-snowden-profile/")
```

```bash
# pick urls in 'queued' or 'failed' with <5 reties and push them to queue
$ python manage.py dispatch_urls --batch 5
Pushed 1 urls to queue

# when fetch worker fails - URL remain 'in progress' in DB
# reconcile worker those to 'failed' and increase retry count by 1
$ $ python manage.py reconcile_records
Marked 0 stuck URLs as failed

# celery worker to consume task
celery -A crawler_service worker -l info -Q crawler
# flower - celery UI
celery -A crawler_service flower --port=5555

```


## ToDo
- Check query access patterns and Indexes
